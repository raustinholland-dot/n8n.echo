Version: 1.0
Purpose: Authoritative sales process + deal discipline rules for DDA reasoning.

---

## 0) How DDA must use this file (MANDATORY)
- Treat this file as **authoritative** for:
  - Sales stages + verifiable outcomes
  - CAS sequencing + violation indicators
  - Forecast discipline + deal control signals
  - DAP definition + quality signals
- Do NOT invent stages, CAS steps, or sequencing rules.
- If inputs conflict with this file, flag as a **process risk**.

---

## 1) Core Operating Principles
- Stages advance only via **verifiable outcomes**
- **CAS leads**, Stage lags
- Optimism never substitutes for evidence
- Process control drives forecast reliability

---

## 2) Sales Stages & Verifiable Outcomes

### Discovery
- Purpose: Understand the problem space
- Must be true:
  - Client pain articulated
  - Potential Champion identified
- Not true yet:
  - No solution approach proposed
  - No validation criteria defined

### Qualify
- Purpose: Confirm pain, intent, access to power
- Must be true:
  - Problem confirmed by Champion
  - Willingness to change validated
  - Buying intent or expansion potential identified
- Key risk:
  - No access to power / unclear buying process

### Prove
- Purpose: Validate Clearwater approach solves the problem
- Must be true:
  - Solution approach co-created
  - Proof/validation criteria defined or being validated
- Non-negotiable sequencing:
  1) Build Approach Document (internal; **no pricing shared**)
  2) Schedule Validation / Approach Call
  3) Conduct Validation / Approach Call
  4) Send Approach Document **with pricing**
- Violation indicator:
  - Pricing shared before Validation Call completed

### Negotiate
- Purpose: Finalize commercial/contract terms
- Must be true:
  - Solution approach accepted
  - Legal/procurement/contracting process active
- Key risk:
  - Uncontrolled redlines / unknown approvals

### Close
- Purpose: Execute agreement
- Must be true:
  - All approvals obtained
  - Contract executed

---

## 3) Critical Activity Stage (CAS)
- CAS = **next required verifiable outcome**
- Current verified deal state = CAS immediately prior to the one listed
- Do not advance until CAS outcome is verifiably completed

---

## 4) Dual Action Plan (DAP) — Definition & Quality
- Definition: client-agreed milestone sequence to reach target outcome (close/start)
- Must include:
  - Client + Clearwater ownership
  - Dates tied to external drivers
  - Alignment to client buying process
- Invalid DAP signals:
  - Internal-only milestones
  - Dates not client-confirmed
  - No linkage to decision/approval step

---

## 5) Forecast Category Discipline
- Forecast is meaningful only for deals closing **this quarter**
- Commit requires buyer control + verifiable path to close
- Downgrade forecast when:
  - Control weakens
  - Scope/timeline changes
  - New approvers emerge
- Forecast Category ≠ Deal Health

---

## 6) Deal Control Signals
- Positive:
  - Client-agreed DAP
  - Access to Executive Sponsor
  - Clear buying/approval process
- Negative:
  - Missed milestones without reset
  - Champion-only communication
  - Budget/approval ambiguity

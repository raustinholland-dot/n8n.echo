  "client_follow_up_email": "Travis and UK,\n\nIt was a pleasure speaking with you both today and hearing about Velentium's progress in Azure.\n\nWe appreciate the clear vision you shared regarding the \"check and balance\" needed between your MSP's level 1 support and your broader security and compliance requirements. Ensuring your ISO 27001 maintenance and Azure security stack are managed by a specialized partner aligns perfectly with how we support our most mature clients.\n\nAs discussed, our next steps are as follows:\n\n- We will update our scoping assumptions and pricing based on the 108 users and 120 endpoints you confirmed.\n\n- I'll then send the updated proposal table to you so you have it in hand for your upcoming MSP renewal discussions.\n\nOnce you have had a chance to review, we can coordinate a brief call to align on the technical delineation of tasks.\n\nWe look forward to speaking with you again.\n\nBest,\nAustin",

  "internal_message_pricing": "Hey Steve, had a discovery call with Velentium. They are looking for a bifurcated model to create a check-and-balance against their local MSP; they want Clearwater to own the back-end security and the MSP to stay in their lane with L1/Physical support.\n\nPlease note, we would not be taking control over the entire Azure environment in a general IT administration way. We are specifically taking over the security management and monitoring of the stack. Their MSP would stay in place to handle the general IT stuff and level 1 user support, and the actual physical rollout of the Intune policies we'd define. It was described as we'd be the security oversight and the MSP as the hands-on IT operations.\n\nCan you help us refresh the MSSP pricing for a Managed Microsoft stack (Sentinel/Defender/Entra ID) based on these updated counts?\n- Azure Specific Services: 1 managed azure and 2 core services\n- Users: 108\n- Endpoints (Workstations): 120\n- Servers: 1 (Azure)\n- Firewalls: 1 (Fortigate 100F)\n- Infrastructure Devices: 36 (Firewall/Switches/APs)\n- Cloud Services: 5\n- External Hosts: 3\n\nLet me know if you need anything else to spin the numbers.",
  "exec_recap_forwardable": "Austin Holland, Richmond, and David K. engaged with Velentium (Travis and UK) to discuss a Managed Security Services (MSS) partnership. Velentium, having recently completed an Azure migration and achieved ISO 27001 certification, is looking to \"bifurcate\" their IT operations. They currently utilize an MSP for level 1 support but seek a specialized security partner to provide a \"check and balance,\" ensuring the \"fox isn't guarding the hen house\" regarding their security and compliance posture."
